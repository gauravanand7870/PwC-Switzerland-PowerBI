## PowerBI Dashboard Design and Analysis for Telecom and HR Diversity

### 1. Telecom Customer Satisfaction Dashboard
**KPIs:**
-Overall customer satisfaction.
-Overall calls answered/abandoned.
-Calls by time.
-Average speed of answer.
-Agent’s performance quadrant (average handle time vs calls answered).

**Findings:**
While general customer satisfaction remains steady, certain peak call times show higher abandonment rates. Agent performance varies widely with a few outliers who have longer call durations but fewer calls answered.

**Suggestions:**
Shift more agents during peak call times to reduce call abandonment. Provide targeted training for agents falling behind in performance.

### 2. Customer Retention Dashboard
**KPIs:**
-Total number of customers at risk.
-Reasons for terminating contracts.
-Patterns or trends leading to termination.
-Customer segmentation (loyal vs. at-risk).
-Historical retention rate.

**Findings:**
A significant number of terminations occur due to dissatisfaction with service. Most terminations also seem reactionary with no pre-emptive communication.

**Suggestions:**
Initiate an early-warning system to identify at-risk customers. Focus on improving service quality. Establish regular check-ins or satisfaction surveys.

### 3. HR Diversity and Inclusion Dashboard
**KPIs:**
-Number of men vs. women.
-Percentage of employees promoted in FY21.
-Percentage of promotions: men vs. women.
-Hires breakdown: men vs. women.
-Employee turnover rate.
-Average performance rating for men and women.

**Findings:**
While hiring seems balanced, promotions heavily favor men. There’s minimal difference in average performance ratings between genders, which does not explain the promotion discrepancy.

**Root Causes:**
Possible unconscious biases during promotions. Lack of clear criteria for promotions. Women might not be in roles that traditionally lead to executive positions.

**Suggestions:**
Provide unconscious bias training. Establish clear criteria for promotions. Ensure equal representation in leadership development programs.
